# Introduction
::: tip
MCASH is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of a truly decentralized Internet and its infrastructure. The MCASH Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers base public blockchain support of high throughput, high scalability, and high availability for all decentralized applications in the MCASH ecosystem.

## Key Advantages

### High Throughput
Under MCASH consensus, a limited number of high calculation performance nodes are selected by users as network witnesses, achieving high throughput by keeping the transactions per second (TPS) of the entire network on an acceptable level. MCASH's robust consensus mechanism enabled it to surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, which allows transaction speeds to compete with existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT. This makes everyday purchases with TRX a convenient possibility.

### Scalability
Applications enjoy a wider variety of ways to be deployed in MCASH because of the network's scalability and highly effective smart contracts. Thanks to the high efficiency and infinite possibilities of the smart contract, MCASH possesses great scalability, allowing for a wide variety of applications to be deployed in MCASH.

The combination of an excellent database structure and account system simplifies the actualization of complex designs and models, which brings convenience to project development and supports high TPS. Existing applications, websites, and operating services can be transferred to the MCASH network, allowing them to better rival against existing institutions by benefiting from the large user base of the MCASH network.

### High Availability

MCASH is keen on building a decentralized consensus mechanism. The network structure, user assets, and intrinsic value will become more reliable with a higher degree of decentralization. Even so, MCASH's consensus mechanism is much more energy-efficient compared with the Proof of Work (PoW) mode.


### Low Cost
MCASH adopts a design with low calculation cost, making it easier for different apps on MCASH to expand its user base and be commercially competitive.

### User-Friendly
MCASH is committed to building utility blockchain products with thorough research on user demands and expectations.

## Core Design
### Unique Consensus
Current PoW mechanisms suffer from high energy consumption, low efficiency, and low TPS. However, MCASH's innovative architectural philosophy guided us toward developing a unique Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) mechanism. Using invaluable feedback and constructive ideas from the blockchain community, we improved the DPoS mechanism to satisfy network demands, thereby coming up with the MCASH consensus mechanism.

### Smart Contract with High Efficiency
It will be fulfilled in the following ways:

* MCASH supports Java development—a programming language that has mature development communities, supports multiple scenarios and is highly effective.
* High-efficiency consensus mechanism
* MCASH embraces excellent database structure and account system to help users with the conversion from complex conceptions and models into utility applications.
### The Future of MCASH
We aim to build a MCASH ecosystem that everyone can participate in and benefit from, with the MCASH network along with its many advantages as the cornerstone of our effort.

* MCASH and its wide variety of affiliated DAPPs not only render users reduced costs but also improved convenience in daily life and financial return.
* By deploying their DAPPs on MCASH, developers can expand their scope of business and bring publicity to their values and beliefs.
* Witnesses support the functioning of MCASH network and gain remuneration for their effort.
Whether a user, developer or MCASH selected witness, each and every one of us devotes ourselves to the construction and prosperity of MCASH’s ecosystem and will be rewarded for our commitment.
